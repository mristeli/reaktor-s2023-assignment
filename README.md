### A solution to Project Birdnest

This repo contains a possible solution to the Reaktor summer trainee 2023 [pre-assignment](https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/). At the time of reading the assignment page and/or the servers that are required to test the solution might have been taken down.

The solution is a perfect combination of adhoccing, functional and callback hell based programming and only a single xml parsing library as a dependency just because. Frontend technology is bleeding edge vanilla JavaScript.

To run the app clone the repo, do `npm install` and command `node index.js`.
